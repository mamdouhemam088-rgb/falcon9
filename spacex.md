# Project Workflow

## 1. Understand the Dataset

- Read the dataset description.
- Identify the target variable.
- Classify features into:

  - Categorical
  - Date/Time
- Describe each feature in your own words.

---

## 2. Data Exploration (EDA)

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data.

Suggested analyses:

- Dataset shape
- Data types
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Class distribution
- Summary statistics
- Correlation matrix
- Distribution of numerical variables
- Frequency of categorical variables
- Landing success by:
  - Launch Site

### 3.2 Remove Duplicates

- Detect duplicate rows.
- Remove duplicates if appropriate.

---

### 3.3 Correct Data Types

Examples:

- Convert dates to datetime
- Convert numerical columns stored as strings
- Convert categorical columns to category type

---

### 3.4 Handle Outliers

Possible methods:

- IQR - boxplot



---

### 3.6 Feature Selection

Determine which features should be used.

---

### 3.7 Encode Categorical Features

Choose appropriate encoding methods.

Examples:

- One-Hot Encoding
- Label Encoding

Explain why the chosen method is appropriate.

Explain which models require scaling.

---

### 3.9 Handle Class Imbalance

If the dataset is imbalanced, consider:

- Class weights
- SMOTE upsample / downsample

Compare results before and after balancing.

---

### 3.10 Train/Test Split

Split the dataset into:

- Training
- Validation (optional)
